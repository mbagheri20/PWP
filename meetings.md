### Minutes
We discussed about the scope of the project. Material might already be enough work for the course. User login is not needed since API's are stateless. There were corrections to the different section and actions to take for those are below. Key concepts not being clearly defined was the thing that we used most time on.

### Action points
Simplify the Main concepts and relations part.
For the API uses section there should be two different clients in two paragraphs explaining different use cases.
In related work section we should classify the type of the API and justify the classification and provide an example.
